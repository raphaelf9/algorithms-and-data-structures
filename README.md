# 📌 Algorithms and Data Structures in C  

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures using the C programming language. 
The goal is to create a well-documented and easy-to-understand resource for those who want to deepen their knowledge in this field.  

⚠️ **This project is under development!** New implementations will be added weekly (maybe montly).
