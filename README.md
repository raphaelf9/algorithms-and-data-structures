# 📌 Algorithms and Data Structures  

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in **C, C#, .NET, and Python**. 
The goal is to create a well-documented and easy-to-understand resource for those who want to deepen their knowledge in this field.  

⚠️ **This project is under development!** New implementations will be added weekly (maybe monthly).
